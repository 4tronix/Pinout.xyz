#Pinout!

###The comprehensive Raspberry Pi Pinout guide for the Raspberry Pi, now with Model B+ and Pi 2

Pinout isn't meant to be printable, but it's a great quick-reference and a comprehensive starter guide to learning about your Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

##What do these numbers mean, anyway?

* BCM - Broadcom pin number, these are the ones you probably want to use with RPi.GPIO
* WiringPi - Wiring Pi pin number, for Gordon's Wiring Pi library
* Physical - Number corresponding to the pins physical location on the header

##Pi 2+

To celebrate the launch of the Pi 2 and the new Pi-enthusiasts it'll bring, Pinout has been updated to be cleaner, more comprehensive and more accurate.

##Model B+

Now that the Raspberry Pi Model B Plus is here, I've updated Pinout with the 14 extra pins you'll find on your shiny new board.

Note: While I've placed a gap to visually separate the additional 14 pins on the B+, you wont find this gap on the actual board!
