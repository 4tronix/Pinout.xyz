This pin doubles up as the UART recieve pin, RXD. It's also commonly known as "Serial". By default your Pi will receive serial commands over this Pi and pass them into a Console, which gives you command-line control over your Pi using a Serial cable.

The UART pins, with an appropriate cable, are extremely useful for setting up a "headless" ( a Pi without a screen ) Pi and getting it connected to a network.
